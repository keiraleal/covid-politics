R project for Brown Statistics class researching 2020 presidential election data and its correlation with COVID-19 infection data 

This project will attempt to find if there is a relationship between political beliefs and Covid-19 cases using a variety of methods. More specifically, the percentage of voters that voted for a particular candidate in the American 2020 Presidential Elections in each state versus the total amount of Covid-19 cases per 1 million residents in each state.

Problem statement: Is there a relationship between the percentage of voters that voted for a particular candidate in the 2020 Elections and the amount of Covid-19 cases per 1 million residents?
